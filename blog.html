		<h3>Computer Vision</h3>
		Computer vision is a simulation of human vision that is meant to train the computer to understand and interpret visional of the world using several algorithms and applications that support this science,<a href="https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/computer-vision.html" target="_blank">Read More About Computer Vision</a> <br><br>
		
		In the last 100 years' people did not know that much about technology as we do now they did not imagine the new and sophisticated technology yet it got discovered and used properly. Starting with the point that everything is possible this project will dive into the sea that is object detection. A process of identifying, localizing, and classification of an object in a scene that is object detection which is a branch of computer vision

		The spread of powerful computers, the availability of high quality, cheap video cameras and the highly need for automated video analysis has created a focused interest in object tracking algorithms. Video analysis has three main steps as: detecting a specific moving objects, tracking an objects between frames and recognize object behavior by analysis their tracks. So object tracking is relevant to the following tasks:<ul class="onorder">
            <li>Recognition based on motion, as identify someone based on gait and automatic object detection, etc.</li>
            <li> Automated surveillance as Detection of suspect activities or unforeseen from a scene.</li>
            <li>Video indexing as retrieving automatic annotation of the videos in databases of multimedia.</li>
            <li>Human interaction with the computer as gesture recognition, tracking eye gaze to be stored in computers etc.</li>
            <li>Traffic monitoring as gathering traffic statistics in real time to direct traffic flow.</li>
            <li>Vehicle navigation as planning path based video and obstacle avoidance capabilities.</li>
</ul>
